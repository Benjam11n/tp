## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.
1. Please do note that this explanation is **intentionally** simplified (i.e. no elaboration on `executeConfirmed`) for the ease of reading and reference. 

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* stores a `CommandHistory` object that stores the past commands of the user. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyCommandHistory` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, command history data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `CommandHistoryStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* provides read-only interfaces (`ReadOnlyAddressBook` and `ReadOnlyCommandHistory`) for controlled data access.
* is implemented by concrete classes `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonCommandHistoryStorage` which extend the abstract generic class `JsonStorage<T, S extends JsonSerializable<T>>` for type-safe serialization.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Current\] Undo/Redo feature

#### Current Implementation

The current undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `CommandTracker`. It tracks the `Undoable` commands i.e. commands that extend `Undoable` in the form of 2 separate stacks: `undoStack` and `redoStack`. 
Additionally, it supports these operations:

* `CommandTracker#getInstance` - Returns the singleton instance of ```CommandTracker```
* `CommandTracker#push` - Pushes a new `UndoableCommmand` onto the undo stack and clears the redo stack
* `CommandTracker#popUndo` - Pops and returns the most recent command from the undo stack
* `CommandTracker#getRedo` - Pops and returns the most recent command from the redo stack
* `CommandTracker#canUndo` - Returns true if there are commands to undo
* `CommandTracker#canRedo` - Returns true if there are commands to redo
* `CommandTracker#clear` - Clears both the undo and redo stacks

Step 1: Initial Application Launch

- State:
  - The application is launched.
  - The address book contains preloaded contacts.

-  Behaviour:
    - No undo or redo operations are available at this point since no changes have been made.

Step 2: Adding a Person

- Action:
  - The user executes the `add` command to add a new person.
  - ```add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@example.com```

- State:
    - The address book now contains the new person, John Doe.

-  Behaviour:
    - The `add` command is executed and is reflected in the new address book state (with the newly added person). 
    - ```CommandTracker.getInstance().push()``` is called to push this command to the undo stack.
        - This is allowed because the ```AddCommand``` extends ```UndoableCommand```.
    - `undo` is now available, but `redo` is not (since no action has been undone yet).

Step 3: Deleting a Person

- Action:
    - The user executes the ```delete``` command to delete the previously added person.
    - ```delete <index>``` where `index` is the location John Doe is stored.

- State:
    - The address book now no longer contains John Doe.

- Behaviour:
    - The ```delete command``` is executed and is reflected in the new address book state (without the deleted person).
    - ```CommandTracker.getInstance().push()``` is called to push this command to the undo stack.
        - This is allowed because the ```DeleteCommand``` extends ```UndoableCommand```.
    - `undo` is still available to restore the deleted person, but `redo` is still not available since delete has not been undone yet.

Step 4: Undoing the DeleteCommand

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

- Action:
    - The user decides to undo the delete command using the ```undo``` command.

- State:
    - The address book is reverted to the state before the delete command, with John Doe restored.

- Behaviour:
  - The ```undo``` command is called.
  - ```CommandTracker.canUndo()``` is called to see if the command can be undone.
      - Since it can, ```CommandTracker.getInstance().popUndo()``` is called to pop the command from the undo stack.
      - Subsequently, this command is also pushed to the redo stack.
  - The ```DeleteCommand#redo``` method is invoked on the last ```delete``` command and restores the deleted person.
  - `undo` is still available (for the initial ```add``` command) and `redo` is available since delete has been undone.

Step 5: Redoing the DeleteCommand

<puml src="diagrams/RedoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="RedoSequenceDiagram" />

- Action:
    - The user decides to redo the delete command using the ```redo``` command.

- State:
    - The address book is reverted to the state after the delete command, with John Doe deleted.

- Behaviour:
    - The ```redo``` command is called.
    - ```CommandTracker.canRedo()``` is called to see if the command can be redone.
        - Since it can, ```CommandTracker.getInstance().popRedo()``` is called to pop the command from the redo stack.
    - The ```DeleteCommand#redo``` method is invoked on the last ```delete``` command and deletes the person again.
    - `undo` is still available (for the initial ```add``` command) and `redo` is no longer available since delete has been redone.

**Note:** At this point, the user should be able to notice that the `undo` and `redo` commands can be called in a circular manner i.e. ```undo -> redo -> undo -> ...```

### \[Proposed\] Possible Undo/Redo Implementation
The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagramProposed.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

# WhoAreYouAgain? - Use Cases

## Use Case 1: Add Contact to Contact List
**System**: WhoAreYouAgain?  
**Use case**: UC01 - Add Contact
**Actor**: User

### Main Success Scenario (MSS):
1. User enters family member's details into command input box.
2. System adds contact to contact list.
3. System displays a message: "New person added: <NAME>; Image: file:/.../tp/build/resources/main/images/defaultUserPicture.png" _(Note: That the message will be different based on the amount of information given to the command. Additionally, defaultUserPicture.png is the default contact image assigned to a contact if none is provided. The file path shown is user-dependent.)_

   **Use case ends.**

### Extensions:
- **2a. User leaves the name field empty.** (e.g. `add n/ `)
    - 2a1. System displays a message: "Names cannot be empty, or only contain spaces or tabs."
    - Use case resumes from step 1 with a non-empty name.
<br>
</br>
- **2b. User enters an invalid name.** (e.g. `add n/Bob~`)
    - 2b1. System displays a message: "Names cannot start or end with a special character." _(note: this message may differ depending on the condition of invalidity (e.g. no special characters at the end of name, no names longer than 150 characters, etc.))_
    - Use case resumes from step 1 with a valid name (e.g. `add n/Bob`).
<br>
</br>
- **2c. User enters a duplicate name.** (e.g. `add n/tom` when "tom" already exists in the contact list)
    - 2c1. System displays an error message that outlines that a duplicate contact already exists.
    - User can choose to retry adding a new, non-duplicate contact from step 1 OR the use case ends here if the user does
      not want to add the duplicate contact.
---

## Use Case 2: View a List of Upcoming Birthdays
**System**: WhoAreYouAgain?  
**Use case**: UC02 - View Upcoming Birthdays  
**Actor**: User

### Main Success Scenario (MSS):
1. User enters `list s/asc` in the command input box.
2. System displays the contact list in order of most to least recent birthdays. _(Note: that contacts with no birthdays will be found at the bottom of the sorted contact list and will be displayed in natural order.)_
3. System also displays a message: "Listed all persons by upcoming birthdays (soonest first)."

   **Use case ends.**


<box type="info" seamless>

**What is natural order?**

- In Java, "natural order" refers to the default ordering of objects as defined by the Comparable interface. It is the inherent or logical way elements of a specific type are expected to be ordered. For example:
- Numbers: Natural order is ascending numerical order (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
- Strings: Natural order is lexicographical (alphabetical) order.
- Dates: Natural order is chronological order.

</box>

### Extensions:
- **2a. The user inputs an invalid list command (e.g. `list sort`).**
    - 2a1. System displays a message on the invalid command format and correct syntax in the result display window.

## Use Case 3: Find a Family Member
**System**: WhoAreYouAgain?  
**Use case**: UC03 - Find Family Member  
**Actor**: User

### Main Success Scenario (MSS):
1. User enters the command to find a family member. (e.g. `find Nic`)
2. System searches and displays the matching family members in the contact list using prefix-matching and fuzzy search. System also displays a message: "x persons listed!" _(where x is the number of persons matching the prefix given)_.

   **Use case ends.**


<box type="info" seamless>

**How does the system match family members?**

- The system uses prefix-matching in order to match names via their prefixes. A simple example of this is shown below:
    - 1. Pre-requisite: Three contacts already exist in the contact list with the prefix `bren` (e.g. `brenda, brenton, brendt`)
    - 2. User enters `find bren` in the command input box.
    - 3. System filters and displays `brenda, brendon and brendt` based on the prefix `bren` provided.
    - 4. User then removes filter by running `list` and then runs `find brend`.
    - 5. System filters and displays `brenda and brendt` based on the prefix `brend` provided.

- Besides using prefix-matching, the system also uses fuzzy search to try to match similar names. This is the fall-back search method if prefix-matching fails. A simple example of this is shown below:
    - 1. Pre-requisite: A contact `Nic Tok` already exists in the contact list.
    - 2. User enters `find ok`.
    - 3. System filters and displays `Nic Tok` based on the fuzzy search of prefix `ok`.
    - 4. User then removes filter by running `list` and then runs `find otk`.
    - 5. System filters and displays `Nic Tok` based on the fuzzy search of prefix `otk`.

- Do note: **fuzzy search may NOT always yield correct results**. This is **NOT a bug**. This behaviour is a result of the threshold of similarity that is used by the fuzzy search function. The accuracy of the fuzzy search is, hence, highly reliant on the prefix used. _(e.g. finding Yashvan with `find van` does not work but `find hvan` works)_

</box>


### Extensions:
- **1a. No matching or similar family member(s) is/are found.**
    - 1a1. System displays a message: “No match found, found 0 similar entries”. No contacts are shown in the contact list.
    - Use case resumes from step 1 with a prefix which exists in the contact list.
<br>
</br>

- **1b. No matching but similar family member(s) is/are found.**
    - 1b1. System displays a message: “No match found, found x similar entries” _(where x is the number of similar family members)_. The similar family member contacts are shown in the contact list in order of insertion.
    - Use case resumes from step 1 with a prefix which exists in the contact list.
<br>
</br>

- **1c. User inputs an incorrect command. (e.g. `find"nic"`)**
    - 1c1. System displays a message: `Unknown command, try typing 'help' for assistance!`.
    - Use case resumes from step 1 with valid `find` syntax.

2. System opens the help window and displays a message: "Opened help window." in the result display box.

   **Use case ends.**

### Extensions:
- **1a. User inputs an incorrect command. (e.g. `helpp`)**
    - 1a1. System displays a message: `Unknown command, try typing 'help' for assistance!`.

## Use Case 5: Edit the Tags of a Contact
**System**: WhoAreYouAgain?  
**Use case**: UC05 - Edit Tags of a Contact  
**Actor**: User

### Main Success Scenario (MSS):
1. User enters the command to edit the tags of the selected contact index in the command input box. (e.g. `edit 1 t/playsMinecraft t/nationalAthlete`)
2. System updates the tags of contact in index of the contact list entered _(contact list is 1-indexed)_. (based on the example above, contact `1` now has tags: playsMinecraft, nationalAthlete)
3. System displays a message: "Edited Person: . . . Tags: NEW TAG(s)" _(where NEW TAG(s) are the tag(s) entered by the user)_. (based on the example above, the message is: "Edited Person: . . . Tags: playsMinecraft, nationalAthlete")

   **Use case ends.**

### Extensions:
- **1a. Contact index input by user is invalid.** (e.g. user enters `edit 11 t/Hello` when there are only 2 contacts in the contact list)
    - 1a1. System displays a message: "The person index provided is invalid".
    - Use case resumes from step 1 with the correct contact index to be edited.
<br>
</br>

- **1b. A duplicate tag is entered by the user** (e.g. user enters `edit 2 t/Hello t/hEllo`)
    - 1b1. System displays a message: "Duplicate tag found (case-insensitive): <dupe-tag>" _(where <dupe-tag> is the duplicate tag found)_"
    - Use case resumes from step 1 with non-duplicate tags entered in the `edit` command.
<br>
</br>

- **1c. The user enters just an empty tag to clear tags.** (e.g. `edit 1 t/`)
    - 1c1. System updates the tags of contact in the corresponding index as empty. (based on the example given above, contact 1 now has no tags)
    - 1c2. System displays a message similar to that of step 3 but the "Tags" portion is not present.
<br>
</br>

  **Use case ends.**

2. System will display a message: "Confirm Deleting Person: NAME ? (y/n)", where NAME is the name of the contact to be deleted. (following our example above, this will display the name of the 1st contact in our contact list)
3. User confirms this deletion by entering `y` in the command input window.
4. System deletes contact from contact list and refreshes the contact list to display the most current contact list.
5. System displays a message: "Deleted Person: NAME", where NAME is the name of the contact that was deleted.

   **Use case ends.**

### Extensions:
- **1a. Contact index input by user is invalid.** (e.g. `delete 11` when there's only 2 contacts in the contact list)
    - 1a1. System displays a message: "The person index provided is invalid".

        - Alternatively, if `delete x`, where x is an integer ≤ 0 is entered, the system displays: "Invalid command format! . . . Parameters: INDEX/INDICES (must be a positive integer)" _(message shortened for brevity)_.
    - 1a2. Use case resumes from step 1 where user enters a valid contact index.

- **3a. User aborts the deletion by entering `n` in the command input window.**
    -  3a1. System displays a message: "Aborted deletion!".

  **Use case ends.**

### Planned Enhancements

Team Size: 5

1. **Make `undo` / `redo` message for edit commands more specific:** Currently, the message only shows the command and name of the person being edited which is too general. We aim to display which specific fields were changed. This provides users with immediate clarity about what was modified and helps prevent accidental data loss when performing multiple `undo` / `redo` commands.

2. **Ensure `undo` / `redo` restore order in any state:** Currently, the order is preserved when `undo` and `redo` is used when the list has no sorters or search filters (i.e. from `list` or `find`) applied. However, the order might not be preserved when an `undo` / `redo` command is executed after sorters or search filters have been applied. We plan to enhance `undo` and `redo` to preserve the order with or without sorters or search filters.

3. **Implement `undo` / `redo` for `clear`:** Currently, `undo` / `redo` are only supported by `edit`, `add` and `delete`. 
   We plan to extend this functionality to `clear` as it will be useful for this "dangerous" command as it currently cannot be undone.

4. **Make clearer error message when using undefined prefixes**: Currently, the error message when a user inputs an undefined prefix, i.e. a prefix the app does not associate with a field, an 'invalid command format' error is raised.
   This is too general. We plan to enhance the message to show the specific prefix which caused the error. This is so that the user
   can quickly identify the mistake in the command.

5. **Improve error message specificity for `edit` and `delete` commands when users input extreme values**: Currently, when users input negative numbers or extremely large numbers as indices, a generic "Invalid command format" error message is displayed. Instead of displaying a generic message, the application should provide clear, targeted feedback such as "Index cannot be negative" or "Index is too large" to help users understand exactly what went wrong.

6. **Make `find` applicable to other fields besides name**: Currently, the find feature is limited to finding by name. We plan to enhance the find feature to allow user to find persons
   through other fields such as relationship and nickname. This would make searching for a forgotten relative much easier and more likely to be successful.

7. **Allow tags to be edited without overwriting them**: Currently, there is no feature that allows the user to edit tags or add to them without erasing all current tags.
   This makes tasks such as adding a tag to the current set of tags difficult. We plan to create a feature which allows users to
   edit or add tags without erasing all current tags.

8. **Expand our image support to allow other extensions**: Currently, the application only supports `.png` images. We plan to expand the supported image formats to include additional common extensions like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.gif`.
   This will allow users to use a wider variety of images for their family members.

9. **Relax the birthday datetime format**: Currently, the birthday datetime format only accepts `DD-MM-YYYY` which is too strict. We plan to relax this restriction to allow for more flexible inputs. This will make the application more user-friendly and accommodating to different date formats.

10. **Improve our duplicate Person detection algorithm**: Currently, the algorithm for detecting duplicate persons may not be robust enough. We plan to enhance this duplicate detection algorithm to more accurately identify duplicate persons. This could be possibly done in the form of adding a confirmation message when duplicate persons may be detected. 
   This will help to ensure that the address book remains clean and free of duplicates.
